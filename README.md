**Objective:**

Create a Todo List application using Angular with Angular Material, Angular Reactive
Forms, and RxJS. The application should have the ability to add, edit, delete, and filter todos.

**Requirements:**

1. **Angular and Angular Material** :
    o Use Angular to build the application.
    o Employ Angular Material for UI components (buttons, forms, dialogs, etc.).
2. **Reactive Forms** :
    o Implement reactive forms for adding and editing todos.
    o Validate todo input fields (e.g., todo name required).
3. **RxJS Events** :
    o Use RxJS to handle form events and filtering.
4. **State Management** :
    o Implement a state management solution to manage the todos (e.g., using a
       service with a BehaviorSubject).
5. **Custom Directives and Pipes** :
    o Create at least one custom directive and one custom pipe to demonstrate
       proficiency.

**Features:**

1. **Todo List** :
    o Display a list of todos with name and description and status.
    o Allow editing and deleting todos.
2. **Add Todo** :
    o A form to add new todos.
    o Use reactive forms to handle input and validation.
3. **Edit Todo** :
    o A form to edit existing todos.
    o Prefill the form with selected todo details.
4. **Delete Todo** :
    o Implement functionality to delete todos.
5. **Filter Todos** :
    o Implement a simple filter to search todos by name or description or status.
6. **Custom Directive** :
    o Create a custom directive to highlight todos based on a certain condition (e.g.,
       a high-priority task).
7. **Custom Pipe** :
    o Create a custom pipe to transform and display the todo list in a specific
       format.
